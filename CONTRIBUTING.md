# Contribution Guidelines for API Cookbook Repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our API Cookbook repository! We're looking for high-quality, impactful projects that showcase the capabilities of our API and provide genuine value to developers.

## Project Quality Standards

We prioritize quality over quantity in all contributions. Here's what we look for:

### Technical Requirements

- **Functional Completeness**: Your project should be fully functional, free of bugs, and include proper error handling.
- **Code Quality**: Code should be clean, well-formatted, well-documented, and follow standard best practices for the language/framework used.
- **Documentation**: Include comprehensive README with:
  - Clear description of what the project does
  - Installation/setup instructions
  - Usage examples
  - Explanation of how the API is leveraged
  - Any limitations or considerations
- **Maintainability**: Code should be structured to be easily maintained and extended.

### Impact Criteria

We're especially interested in projects that demonstrate one or more of the following:

1. **Solves Real Problems**: Addresses actual use cases that developers might encounter
2. **Educational Value**: Teaches important concepts about API usage or implementation patterns
3. **Novel Applications**: Shows innovative or unexpected ways to leverage the API
4. **Vertical-Specific Solutions**: Demonstrates the API's utility in specific industries or domains
5. **Integration Examples**: Shows how to effectively combine our API with other tools or services

## Submission Process

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork of the cookbook repository
2. **Create a New Directory**: Name it descriptively after your project
3. **Implement Your Project**: Follow the quality guidelines above
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure everything works as expected
5. **Update the README**: Add your project to the README for visibility. 
5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Include a detailed description of your project and what makes it valuable

## Review Criteria

When reviewing submissions, we evaluate based on:

- **Functionality**: Does it work as described?
- **Code Quality**: Is the implementation well-crafted?
- **Originality**: Does it add something new to the cookbook?
- **Usefulness**: Would other developers find this helpful?
- **Documentation**: Is it well-explained and easy to follow?

## Examples of High-Impact Projects

- A specialized search application focused on a particular domain (e.g., legal research, academic papers)
- A browser extension that enhances productivity or learning
- An automated workflow tool that solves a specific business problem
- An integration with popular platforms or productivity tools
- An innovative data visualization of API results
- A tool addressing a specific industry challenge

## What to Avoid

- Projects with minimal functionality beyond basic API calls
- Poorly documented implementations
- Projects that essentially duplicate existing cookbook examples
- Code with security issues or significant bugs
- Projects focused on prohibited use cases

Thank you for helping us build a valuable resource for our developer community! We look forward to seeing your innovative applications of our API.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. 
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Code of Conduct

* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or

permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [api@perplexity.ai]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
