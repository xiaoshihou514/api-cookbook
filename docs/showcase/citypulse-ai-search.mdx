## How It Uses Perplexity Sonar

CityPulse leverages two key Perplexity models:

**Sonar for Real-Time Data**
```python
# Get current local information with geographic context
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sonar",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user", 
        "content": f"Find current events, restaurants, and alerts near {lat}, {lng}"
    }],
    response_format={"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"schema": LOCAL_INFO_SCHEMA}}
)
```

**Sonar Reasoning for Personalized Insights**
```python
# Generate AI-powered location recommendations
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sonar-reasoning",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": f"Provide personalized insights for {location_name}: what to try, best times to visit, pro tips"
    }]
)
```

The app uses structured JSON schemas to ensure consistent data formatting and includes citation tracking for source verification.
