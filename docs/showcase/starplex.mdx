## How StarPlex Uses Perplexity Sonar API

StarPlex leverages Perplexity's Sonar API through a **multi-module intelligence architecture**:

**Market Analysis Engine**
Uses Sonar Pro for comprehensive market validation, combining Google Trends data with AI analysis to generate market cap estimates, AI-disruption scores, and growth projections with structured JSON outputs.

**Competitor Intelligence**
Employs multiple concurrent Sonar queries to identify competing companies, funding status, and threat levels. Each competitor receives a 1-10 threat score with detailed competitive positioning analysis.

**VC & Co-founder Matching**
Leverages Sonar's real-time web knowledge to find relevant investors and potential co-founders, scoring matches based on investment thesis alignment, expertise fit, and geographic proximity.

**Context-Aware Business Assistant**
Implements RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) by feeding all research data into Sonar conversations, creating a knowledgeable startup advisor that can answer questions about market positioning, competitive threats, and strategic decisions.

**Geographic Intelligence**
Combines Sonar's demographic insights with Mapbox geocoding to create interactive heatmaps showing where target audiences are concentrated globally.

## Code Explanation

* **Backend**: Python FastAPI with AsyncIO for concurrent Perplexity API calls across multiple analysis modules
* **Frontend**: Next.js with React 19, featuring Cobe for 3D globe visualization and Mapbox GL for interactive mapping
* **AI Integration**: Multi-model Perplexity strategy using Sonar Pro for complex analysis and Sonar for faster queries
* **Data Pipeline**: Intelligent caching, structured JSON responses, and real-time streaming for immediate user feedback
* **Visualization**: Dynamic data binding between Perplexity insights and interactive globe/map interfaces
