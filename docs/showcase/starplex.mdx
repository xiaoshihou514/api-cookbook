# StarPlex

StarPlex is an AI-powered startup intelligence platform designed to help entrepreneurs validate their business ideas and connect with the resources they need to succeed. Powered primarily by Perplexity Sonar Grounded LLM, it features an interactive 3D globe as its main UI. Simply enter your startup idea, and watch as the AI engine analyzes and visualizes insights directly on the globeâ€”mapping out competitors, markets, demographics, VCs, and potential co-founders across the world in real-time.

## Features

- **Market Validation**: Analyzes if there's a need for the startup, market capitalization, geographic usage, historical growth, and projected growth.
- **Competitor Research**: Identifies similar startups through an interactive map filter.
- **Demographic Research**: Maps where the target market is located.
- **VC & Co-Founder Discovery**: Helps find the best-fit VC and potential co-founders with interactive map filters.
- **Interactive 3D Globe**: Visualizes all data and insights on an interactive globe.
- **Slide Deck Generation**: Automatically generates a pitch deck based on the analysis.
- **RAG Context-Aware Chatbot**: A chatbot that understands the user's business and data.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Python 3.8+
- Perplexity API Key
- Mapbox Token
- SERP API Key

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JerryWu0430/StarPlex.git
    cd StarPlex
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Create a `.env` file and add your API keys:
    ```
    PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_api_key_here
    SERPAPI_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
    Then run the backend server:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm i
    npm run dev
    ```

## Usage

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Enter your startup idea in the input field to begin the analysis. Use the interactive globe and map filters to explore the generated data on market trends, competitors, and more.

## Code Explanation

StarPlex leverages the Perplexity API (primarily the Sonar Pro model) as its core intelligence engine. The backend, built with Python and FastAPI, handles requests for AI-powered analysis. It features a centralized client for Perplexity that includes caching to optimize API usage and structured prompts for reliable JSON outputs.

The frontend is built with Next.js and uses Cobe for the 3D globe visualization and Mapbox GL for interactive maps.

### Example Perplexity API Usage

```python
from perplexity import Perplexity

client = Perplexity()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sonar",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a market analysis expert..."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze the market for [startup idea]"}
    ],
    temperature=0.7
)
```
