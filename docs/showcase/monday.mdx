**Monday** is a voice-enabled AI learning companion designed to bridge the gap between natural language queries and high-quality educational content. Inspired by Marvel's JARVIS and FRIDAY, Monday delivers tailored responses in three modes—Basic, Reasoning, and Deep Research—while integrating immersive visualizations, curated video content, and accessibility-first design.

## Features

* **Three Learning Modes**: Basic factual answers, step-by-step reasoning, and deep research investigations
* **Voice-first interaction** for hands-free learning with natural language processing
* **Real-time 3D visualizations** of concepts using Three.js & WebXR
* **Curated educational YouTube video integration** from trusted sources
* **Multi-modal feedback** combining text, speech (via ElevenLabs), and spatial panels
* **VR-optional design** for immersive experiences without requiring a headset
* **Accessibility-focused interface** for mobility- and vision-impaired users

## Prerequisites

* Node.js 18 LTS or newer
* Modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox recommended)
* Microphone for voice interaction
* Optional: VR headset for immersive mode (WebXR compatible)
* Perplexity API key, ElevenLabs API key, and YouTube API key

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/srivastavanik/monday.git
cd monday
git checkout final
cd nidsmonday

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file and set your API keys
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_api_key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Start Backend Server
node backend-server.js

# Start frontend
npm run dev
```

## Usage

1. Launch the app in your browser
2. Say **"Hey Monday"** to activate the assistant
3. Ask a question in one of three modes:
   - **Basic Mode** – "What is photosynthesis?"
   - **Reasoning Mode** – "Think about how blockchain works."
   - **Deep Research Mode** – "Research into the history of quantum mechanics."
4. View answers as floating text panels, voice responses, and interactive 3D models

## Code Explanation

* **Frontend**: TypeScript with Three.js for 3D visualizations and WebXR for VR support
* **Backend**: Node.js with Socket.IO for real-time voice command processing
* **AI Integration**: Perplexity Sonar API for intelligent responses with reasoning extraction
* **Voice Processing**: ElevenLabs for speech synthesis and natural language understanding
* **Content Curation**: YouTube API integration with smart keyword extraction for educational videos
* **Accessibility**: Voice-first design with spatial audio and haptic feedback support
