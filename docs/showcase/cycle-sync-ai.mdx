# CycleSyncAI: Personalized Health Plans Powered by Sonar API

## 🚀 Overview

**CycleSyncAI** is an iOS app designed to provide personalized **diet and workout recommendations** tailored to a woman’s **menstrual cycle phase**.

By integrating menstrual data from Apple **HealthKit** and optional user profile inputs (age, weight, height, medical conditions, dietary restrictions, goals, and preferences), the app generates dynamic, phase-aware suggestions to support holistic wellness.

Unlike static wellness tools, **CycleSyncAI** leverages **Perplexity’s Sonar Pro API** to deliver **expert-informed**, LLM-generated guidance — including a daily grocery list and motivational feedback — customized to the user's cycle and lifestyle.

## 🧠 Problem & Solution

> **Why it matters:**  
Most apps overlook the hormonal changes that affect women’s fitness and nutrition needs across their cycle, leaving users with generic advice.

## 💡 Motivation

> “I wanted a tailored regime for myself and couldn’t find it all in one place.”
