**CycleSyncAI** is an iOS app designed to provide personalized **diet and workout recommendations** tailored to a woman's **menstrual cycle phase**.

By integrating menstrual data from Apple **HealthKit** and optional user profile inputs (age, weight, height, medical conditions, dietary restrictions, goals, and preferences), the app generates dynamic, phase-aware suggestions to support holistic wellness.

Unlike static wellness tools, **CycleSyncAI** leverages **Perplexity's Sonar Pro API** to deliver **expert-informed**, LLM-generated guidance — including a daily grocery list and motivational feedback — customized to the user's cycle and lifestyle.

## Problem & Solution

> **Why it matters:**  
Most apps overlook the hormonal changes that affect women's fitness and nutrition needs across their cycle, leaving users with generic advice.

**CycleSyncAI** bridges this gap by combining Apple HealthKit data with Sonar Pro's LLM to generate **adaptive, cycle-aware recommendations** for better health outcomes.

## Features

* **Personalized diet & workout suggestions** per cycle phase
* Syncs with Apple HealthKit for real-time cycle tracking
* User profile inputs for advanced personalization (age, goals, restrictions, etc.)
* **Auto-generated daily grocery list**
* Smooth, modern UI with gradients and subtle animations
* **Motivational AI feedback** tailored to user preferences
* Local data storage and private processing

## Motivation

> "I wanted a tailored regime for myself and couldn't find it all in one place."

**CycleSyncAI** was born from the need for a science-backed, easy-to-use app that adapts wellness guidance to women's natural hormonal rhythms, something missing in most mainstream fitness and nutrition platforms.

2. Open in **Xcode**  
3. Ensure Apple HealthKit is enabled on your device  
4. Insert your **Sonar Pro API key**

## Sonar API Usage

The app sends structured prompts to the **Sonar Pro API** including:

* Cycle phase (from HealthKit)
* User profile info (age, weight, goals, etc.)
* Meal preferences & restrictions

In return, it receives:

* **Personalized diet plan**
* **Custom workout plan**
* **Daily grocery list**
* **Motivational feedback**

These are parsed and rendered as styled HTML inside the app using WebViews.
