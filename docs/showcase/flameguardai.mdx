## ⚙️ How it works

### The FlameGuard AI™ Process

1. **📸 Upload**: User uploads a photo of their property
2. **👁️ AI Vision Analysis**: OpenAI Vision API identifies specific vulnerabilities (e.g., flammable roof, dry brush nearby)
3. **🔍 Deep Research**: For each risk, we generate a **custom research plan** and run **iterative agentic-style calls** to Perplexity Sonar
4. **📄 Report Generation**: Research is **aggregated, organized, and formatted** into an actionable HTML report — complete with citations, links, and visual guidance
5. **📧 Delivery**: Detailed report sent via email with DIY solutions and professional recommendations

### 🔍 Deep Research with Perplexity Sonar API

The real innovation is how we use the **Perplexity Sonar API**:

- We treat it like a research assistant gathering the best available information
- Each vulnerability triggers multiple queries covering severity, mitigation strategies, and localized insights
- Results include regional fire codes, weather patterns, and local contractor availability

This kind of **structured, trustworthy, AI-powered research would not be possible without Perplexity**.

### Technical Stack

FlameGuard AI™ is powered by a modern GenAI stack and built to scale:

- **Frontend**: Lightweight HTML dashboard with user account control, photo upload, and report access
- **Backend**: Python (Flask) with RESTful APIs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (local) with **Azure SQL-ready** schema
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI Vision API + Perplexity Sonar API
- **Cloud-ready**: Built for **Azure App Service** with Dockerized deployment

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Successfully used **OpenAI Vision + Perplexity Sonar API** together in a meaningful, real-world workflow
- Built a functioning **MCP server** that integrates seamlessly with Claude for desktop users
- Created a product that is **genuinely useful for homeowners today** — not just a demo
- Kept the experience simple, affordable, and scalable from the ground up
- Made structured deep research feel accessible and trustworthy

## 📚 What we learned

- The **Perplexity Sonar API** is incredibly powerful when used agentically — not just for answers, but for reasoning.
- Combining **multimodal AI (image + research)** opens up powerful decision-support tools.
- Users want **actionable insights**, not just data — pairing research with guidance makes all the difference.
- Trust and clarity are key: our design had to communicate complex information simply and helpfully.

## 🚀 What's next for FlameGuard AI™ - Prevention is Better Than Cure

We're just getting started.

### Next Steps:
- 🌐 Deploy to **Azure App Services** with production-ready database
- 📱 Launch mobile version with location-based scanning
- 🏡 Partner with **home inspection services** and **homeowners associations**
- 💬 Enhance Claude/MCP integration with voice-activated AI reporting
- 💸 Introduce B2B plans for real estate firms and home safety consultants
- 🛡️ Expand database of **local contractor networks** and regional fire codes

We're proud to stand with homeowners — not just to raise awareness, but to enable action.

**FlameGuard AI™ – Because some homes survive when others don't.**
